	<h1>General Education</h1>
	<h3>Short Term Goals</h3>
	<p>I would like to graduate from Iowa State University by the end of Spring 2017 semester with a Cumulative GPA of
		at least 3.0. Afterwards, I would like to find a full time position doing software development.</p>
	<h3>Long Term Goals</h3>
	<p>I would like to have a career developing software applications used by people around the world.</p>
	<h3>General Education Electives</h3>
	<p>The most important thing general electives have helped to teach me is time management. General Electives seem to
		have more frequent, shorter homework assignments than most of my technical electives.</p>
	<p>One of my general education electives, HD FS 276, "Human Sexuality", was a class I took in my sophomore class at
		Iowa State. The topics covered in that class really gave me a better perspective on the different kinds of
		people in this world, some of which I had no idea even existed. Putting this into perspective, as a Software
		Engineer, I would be developing software that people like these could possibly be using every day for the rest
		of their lives. It would definitely help to know at least a little bit about them.</p>
	<p>Another class I took includes Econ 101, which gave me a broader perspective on how money works in the
		real world. The things I learned in that class will help me make better choices when it comes to deciding if
		certain features should be in a particular product or not. Some features of a product could possibly affect the
		economy, and it is important to realize that as you are working on it.</p>
	<p>I've also taken two music classes, music 102, "Intro to music listening", and music 302, "Western Music
		Masterpieces", have been a huge help. When I've been working on a hard problem for most of the day, and I just
		need to take my mind off of it for a while, I can focus on these music classes. I'll take this to heart in the
		future, and know that if I need to take a break from something, I can learn something about a different genre of
		music, or even play some form of instrument myself, just to give myself a break from everything else.</p>
	<p>My final General Elective course was Pol S 215, "Intro to American Government". This is less of a class that will
		help me as a software engineer, and more of a class that will help me as a US Citizen. The topics covered in
		this class went over how the US government works, all the checks and balances, the three branches, etc. Knowing
		how the system works will help me make better decisions in regard to the country later on in life.</p>
