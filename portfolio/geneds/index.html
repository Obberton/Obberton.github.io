	<h3>Short Term Goals</h3>
	<p>I would like to graduate from Iowa State University by the end of Spring 2017 semester with a Cumulative GPA of
		at least 3.0. Afterwards, I would like to find a full time position doing software development.</p>
	<h3>Long Term Goals</h3>
	<p>I would like to have a career developing software applications used by people around the world.</p>
	<h3>How do General Education Electives help?</h3>
	<p>The most important thing general electives have helped to teach me is time management. General Electives seem to
		have more frequent, shorter homework assignments than most of my technical electives.</p>
	<p>Another thing is how general education electives are more for life-outside-of-work activities. For example, HD FS
		276, "Human Sexuality" was a class I took in my sophomore class at Iowa State. The topics covered in that class
		really gave me a better perspective on the kinds of people in this world, some of which I had no idea even
		existed. Music 102, or "Intro to Music Listening", was a class I took my freshman year, and it exposed me to a
		variety of musical genres which I never would have known about otherwise, and a lot of them I really enjoy
		listening to</p>
