	<h1>Cumulative Reflection</h1>
	<p>Throughout my 4 years at Iowa State, I've learned several things that will definitely help me through life. Some of which are <em>already</em> helping me.</p>
	<p>Software Engineering, as my major at Iowa State, has helped me develop my problem-solving skills, as well as formulate opinions for things unrelated to engineering.</p>
	<p>The way I design systems has definitely been improved through my time at Iowa State. Before coming here, I hadn't had any experience at all designing anything ever. Now, I'm glad to say I've helped design games through Game Development Club. I've designed software using design patterns I've learned through Com S 362, the design patterns class. The ways I've learned that you can store data quickly and efficiently are incredible. Talking to people about graph traversals, binary search trees, doubly-linked hash maps, and so on has honestly been one of the better parts of going to Iowa State.</p>
	<p>Working in groups is another thing that Iowa State has done really well for me. I've had at least 6 or 7 different classes that required me to work with a group at some point during class. As a result, I feel I can confidently go into a new project with a group and feel like we can get it done efficiently.</p>
	<p>One of a software engineer's best friends while they're working is the internet. If they are faced with a difficult problem, and don't know where to start, the internet is a great place to start. If they have specific questions, StackOverflow has a great community of people who are experienced in programming all sorts of different things, and are very good at helping out someone in need. In addition, a lot of the documentation for the various programs and tools we use is online. For instance, in Game Development Club, the most commonly used game engine is Unity, with GameMaker as a close second. All of the documentation for both of those, including the interfaces you can use to write code, can be found online.</p>
	<p>That being said, there are definitely some things that I wish I could have done better as a student at Iowa State. While I am generally pretty good at working with people when needed for projects, outside of that, I don't talk much. The amount of social interaction I've had with people I wasn't working with wasn't very much. Part of this is because of my own personality: I'm really not very good at talking to people. I feel like most of the people in the world are not engineers, but everyone that I've had to talk to through class and the projects I've done <em>are</em> engineers. As a result, I feel like my time at Iowa State has made me <em>worse</em> at talking to people (who aren't engineers), because I haven't had many people to talk to. The amount of activities I'm in and actually interested in were made mostly for engineers (and computer scientists, but they're practically the same thing). The only other people interested in game development and the club were designers looking to make art for games, and while I went, that was maybe 2 or 3 people. Not a lot.</p>
	<p>Communication with people not in the same field isn't the only thing that I wish I could have changed. </p>
	<p>I've also been pretty burnt out lately. In order to graduate in 4 years, which has been a goal of mine since I started, I have to take 3-4 courses, which the university calls "problem-solving courses," <b>every semester</b> past my first year. When I first started, I didn't know for sure if I wanted to be a Software Engineer, so I took a lot of my General Education electives first. Apparently that was a really bad idea. Now instead of taking that music class I took my freshman year instead, I have to take <em>YET ANOTHER</em> programming course. This wouldn't even be that bad if I didn't ALSO have a job that I have to work 15-20 hours every week designing and implementing web applications for the university at WebDev. If we follow the general rule of thumb about classwork (spend 3 hours outside of class for every credit hour you are taking), apply that to 10-ish credit hours every semester for CS courses, and add my job, that's 55 hours of logic and programming things that I am expected to do every week. Every Semester. On top of all of the other classes I have to take. I'm sick and tired of it right now.</p>
