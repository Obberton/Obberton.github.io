	<h1>Thomson Reuters</h1>
	<p>During the summer of 2016, I worked as a Configuration Management Intern at Thomson Reuters in Eagan, MN. During my time there, I participated in a few projects including setting up multiple servers for <a href="https://jenkins.io/">Jenkins</a>, as well as developing scripts for helping to manage some Jenkins functions.</p>
	<p>While setting up Jenkins, I had to develop instructions and bash scripts for how to download Tomcat, as well as the WAR file that Jenkins is actually contained in, as well as how to start the server, and do the initial Jenkins setup. Those instructions were passed off to a separate team, who actually has sudo access on the production servers, in order to set up the Jenkins server.</p>
	<p>After that has been set up, I can log in to Jenkins and start setting up all of the different plugins that we need, experiment with them, and make sure they work well with each other. The most notable plugins we used were the plugins for Selenium, TFS, and Git.</p>
	<p>Selenium is a testing tool used to test UI for web applications. When I was there, we used Selenium mainly for simple login and search testing. We used mostly TFS to store the files needed to run the Selenium tests, but were looking into using git instead.</p>
	<p>Overall, I learned a ton about Jenkins and how it works, as well as how engineering works in larger companies. We used a SCRUM-based method, where we had short stand-up meetings every Tuesday and Thursday to go over what has been done, what still needs to be done, and what is keeping us from getting things done, as well as a planning meeting every 2 weeks to go over what needs to be done every iteration.</p>
