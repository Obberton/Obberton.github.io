<h1>
    <small>My name is</small>
    <b>Robert Young</b>.
</h1>
<p>I'm a junior in Software Engineering at Iowa State University. I take mostly Computer Science/Software Engineering
    courses, while working part time at <a href="http://webdev.its.iastate.edu">ITS WebDev</a>.</p>

<h2>Game Design</h2>

<p>In my free time, I am learning as much as I can about the design and implementation of video games. I have done
    several small projects both on my own and with other people. As a member of Iowa State's Game Development Club, I
    enjoy participating in Game Jams and workshops, as well as social nights. <br><br>A <b>Game Jam</b> is an event
    where you get together with two or three other people and try to make a game in a very short amount of time (usually 48 hours).
    <br><br>
    So far, my favorite tool to develop games with is <a href="http://unity3d.com/">Unity3d</a>, where the main language
    I use is C#.</p>
