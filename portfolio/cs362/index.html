<h1>Com S 362</h1>
<h2>Media Rental</h2>
<p>My junior year of college, I took Computer Science 362, which is the design patterns course for Iowa State
	University. In this class, we were to work in groups of 2-4 and make a project over the course of the semester. The
	project my group chose to do was a media rental application, which would help store managers keep track of different
	movies, CDs, and video games, as well as possibly books, that they have and have rented or sold to customers.</p>
