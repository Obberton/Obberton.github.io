	<h1>Com S 309 - "Not Minecraft"</h1>
	<p>Com S 309 is a project class where we had to come up with a project of our own to implement, in order to
		practicethings like agile development, and using iterative cycles in order to improve upon software we had
		alreadystarted.So the first iteration, we had a very basic game set up, that was barely functional, and each
		iterationafterward,we managed to make it quite a bit better. By the end of the semester, we had a halfway decent
		game that we couldcall our own.</p>
	<p>The game we made is actually very similar to Minecraft in the sense that it uses procedural generation in
		ordertogenerate the world. We don't have nearly as many different types of blocks as Minecraft, but we do have
		monstersthat we can spawn whenever we want, and a health and inventory system. It was also designed for VR, and
		testedonthe Oculus Rift DK2.</p>
