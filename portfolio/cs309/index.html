<h1>Com S 309</h1>
<h2>Not Minecraft</h2>
<p>Com S 309 is a project class where we had to come up with a project of our own to implement, in order to practice
	things like agile development, and using iterative cycles in order to improve upon software we had already started.
	So the first iteration, we had a very basic game set up, that was barely functional, and each iteration afterward,
	we managed to make it quite a bit better. By the end of the semester, we had a halfway decent game that we could
	call our own.</p>
<p>The game we made is actually very similar to Minecraft in the sense that it uses procedural generation in order to
	generate the world. We don't have nearly as many different types of blocks as Minecraft, but we do have monsters
	that we can spawn whenever we want, and a health and inventory system. It was also designed for VR, and tested on
	the Oculus Rift DK2</p>
