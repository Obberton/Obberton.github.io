	<h1>Com S 309 - "Not Minecraft"</h1>
	<p>Com S 309 is a project class where we had to come up with a project of our own to implement, in order to
		practice things like agile development, and using iterative cycles in order to improve upon software we had
		already started.So the first iteration, we had a very basic game set up, that was barely functional, and each
		iteration afterward,we managed to make it quite a bit better. By the end of the semester, we had a halfway
		decent
		game that we could call our own.</p>
	<p>The game we made is actually very similar to Minecraft in the sense that it uses procedural generation in
		order to generate the world. We don't have nearly as many different types of blocks as Minecraft, but we do have
		monsters that we can spawn whenever we want, and a health and inventory system. It was also designed for VR, and
		tested on the Oculus Rift DK2.</p>
	<p> The main thing I did in this project was the procedural generation. Unity only has 2-dimensional perlin noise,
		so I had to go through and make a similar function, but using 3d noise. I also multithreaded it, so we could
		generate multiple chunks of land simultaneously.</p>
	<p>Some things I had to consider while creating the generation code was how the chunks are stored in memory, so I
		could go back and let the other people working on the project know how they could modify the blocks, since this
		is a game where you can interact with the environment.</p>
