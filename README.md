# Obberton13.github.io

This is the file where I can keep track of what things I need to put onto my site, and where.

I need to:
* find all of the game jam stuff that I can, as well as Ludum Dare 31 stuff (on github)
* Add all a playable demo to the site
    * If I can't get a web version of a game, get some gameplay footage and put it on Youtube, then embed the youtube player.
* Make the site look a lot better.
    * a Navbar would be a great idea. I plan on having a lot of stuff in here about what I did and who I am, and not all of those will fit on the main page.
    * A title bar with my name and a picture of me that I can put on every page.
    * A footer claiming all of this as my own.
    * other things as I see necessary.
